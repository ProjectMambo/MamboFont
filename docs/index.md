# MamboFont

MamboFont is Project Mambo's generated typeface. A small Python blueprint compiler produces four deterministic TTF and WOFF2 weights from direct filled outlines.

## Family

- **Mambo Font** is a 500-unit monospace family in Regular 400, Medium 500, SemiBold 600, and Bold 700.

## Design

The family uses square counters, right-angle corners, and no rounded or beveled corner treatment. True diagonals remain only when they identify the glyph and have level ends. All weights share one blueprint topology while thickness grows inward.

The current review pilot covers space plus 23 representative letters and figures. The milestone target is 218 printable ASCII, Latin-1, and Windows-1252 characters after the design grammar is approved.

## Current status

Version 0.4.0 is an intentionally incomplete design pilot. The direct-outline generator and local validation exist; no release files, tag, or downstream migration have been made.
